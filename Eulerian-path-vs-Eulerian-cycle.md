Eulerian path vs Eulerian cycle

- An Eulerian path is a finite graph which visits every edge exactly once.
- An Eulerian Cycle is an Eulerian path which starts and ends on the same vertex. That means it must fulfill both Eulerian path (visit every edge exactly once AND start and end on the same vertex)
