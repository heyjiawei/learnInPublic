What is a daemon?
In multitasking computer operating systems, daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under direct control of an interactive user.

Systems often start daemons at boot time which will respond to network requests, hardware activity, or other programs by performing some task. Daemons such as cron jobs may also perfom defined tasks at scheduled times.
