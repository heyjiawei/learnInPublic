Difference between SSH and SSL
- SSH which stands for Secure Shell is used for authentication. Authentication verifies if you are who you say to be
- SSH has a built in user/password authentication system. It uses port 22
- SSH is the common way of safely administering remote servers

- SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer and is used for authorization. Authorization refers to the level of access granted to a person

So basically, 
SSL is used to ensure messages are not listened to while SSH is use to securely login to remote servers
