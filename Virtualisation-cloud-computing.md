Virtualisation is a component within cloud computing
Virtualisation is separating operating system from hardware. Cloud computing includes this and also includes separating application from hardware
Virtualisation gives you a layer on the hardware that you can install an instance of an operating system
You install a hypervisor on the hardware, then install the operating system on top of the hypervisor. These operating systems on top of the hypervisor are called instances
That operating system then becomes an instance of an operating system
You can move instances between different hypervisors
You can install different operating system on these instances. They will operate on the same server. This means you can run many different operating systems on one server
Type 1 hypervisor
Is a native or bare-metal hypervisor. The hypervisor is installed onto a computer that has no operating system. Different instances are then created from the hypervisor
Type 2 hypervisor
Already have an operating system on the computer. On the operating system, you install a hypervisor like virtualbox, virtual PC, VM ware fusion. Then the instance's operating system is installed onto the hypervisor
You don't need the management software
This is the most common virtualisation
The virtualisation will always take the full amount of RAM/ resources even if it doesn't use it all
There might be some network problems between instances on the same computer
You can convert your current operating system and its installed applications on your hardware to Virtualisation
You can virtualise your network security too
