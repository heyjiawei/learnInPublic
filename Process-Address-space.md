Process Address space

- The process address space is a set of logical addresses that a process references in its code.

There are 3 types of addresses used in a program before and after memory is allocated:
Symbolic addresses:
- The addresses used in a source code. 
- The variable names, constants, and instruction labels are the basic elements of the symbolic address space.

Relative addresses:
- At the time of compilation, a compiler converts symbolic addresses into relative addresses.

Physical addresses: 
- The loader generates these addresses at the time when a program is loaded into main memory.

- Virtual and physical addresses are the same in compile-time and load-time address binding schemes.
- Virtual and physical addresses differ in execution-time address-binding schemes.
