The shortest path is 9 while the MST is a 'different path' at 10

*a spanning tree means all vertices must be connected with the minimum possible number of edges. A spanning tree does not have cycles*
*In a weighted graph, a minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree that has minimum weight than all other spannning trees of the same graph*
*If a graph contains a "negative cycle" (i.e. a cycle whose edges sum to a negative value) that is reachable from the source, then there is no cheapest path: any path that has a point on the negative cycle can be made cheaper by one more walk around the negative cycle.*
*Articulation Point. A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) iff removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the graph. For a disconnected undirected graph, an articulation point is a vertex removing which increases number of connected components.*
BFS
- O(V+E)
DFS
- O(V+E)
Shortest Path from source node to all vertices - Dijkstra
- Greedy algorithm that always go for the next available lowest weighted path. Constructs a shortest path tree from the source node
- Does not work with negative weight edges
- Time Complexity of O(V^2). If the input graph is represented using adjacency list, it can be reduced to O(E log V) with binary heap
Shortest Path between every pair of vertices - Floyd Warshall Algorithm
- Compares all possible paths through the graph between each pair of vertices
- Can take negative weight edges but with no negative cycles
- O(V^3)
Prims Minimum Spanning Tree
- A greedy algorithm that constructs a minimum spanning tree by comparing whether the next edge it picks is of the smallest weight
- Works on undirected graphs only
- Works with negative weight edges
- Time Complexity of the above program is O(V^2). If the input graph is represented using adjacency list, then the time complexity of Primâ€™s algorithm can be reduced to O(E log V) with the help of binary heap.
Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree
- A greedy algorithm that constructs a minimum spanning tree by first sorting the edges in descending order of their weight. It then picks the smallest weighted edges to form the minimum spanning tree - that is, keep if a cycle is not formed, discard it otherwise
- O(ElogE) or O(ElogV). Sorting of edges takes O(ELogE) time. After sorting, we iterate through all edges and apply find-union algorithm. The find and union operations can take atmost O(LogV) time. So overall complexity is O(ELogE + ELogV) time. The value of E can be atmost O(V2), so O(LogV) are O(LogE) same. Therefore, overall time complexity is O(ElogE) or O(ElogV)
Topological Sorting (only for Directed Acyclic Graphs aka DAG)
- is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
- The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with in-degree as 0 (a vertex with no incoming edges).
- O(V+E)
Articulation Points (Or cut vertices) in a graph
- O(V+E) to find all articulation points with DFS
- In DFS, we follow vertices in tree form called DFS tree. In DFS tree, a vertex u is parent of another vertex v, if v is discovered by u (obviously v is an adjacent of u in graph). In DFS tree, a vertex u is articulation point if one of the following two conditions is true.
1) u is root of DFS tree and it has at least two children.
2) u is not root of DFS tree and it has a child v such that no vertex in subtree rooted with v has a back edge to one of the ancestors (in DFS tree) of u.
Bridges in a graph
- An edge in an undirected connected graph is a bridge iff removing it disconnects the graph. For a disconnected undirected graph, definition is similar, a bridge is an edge removed which increases the number of disconnected components.
- We do DFS traversal of the given graph. In DFS tree an edge (u, v) (u is parent of v in DFS tree) is bridge if there does not exist any other alternative to reach u or an ancestor of u from subtree rooted with v.
