System Design
1. Talk about its features
2. Narrow down to a few features where you will elaborate on their design
3. Focus on core features first

On starting:
1. Provide the native solution
2. Explain why it wouldn't work. What are the bottlenecks it will eventually face
3. Point out some characteristics of this application. Then explain how we can optizmize with these in mind
4. Provide the optimized solution, explaining its tradeoffs and potential bottlenecks if you see any
