CIDR
Classless Inter-Domain Routing

A class C network would have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 which means that 24 bits are used for the network.
In CIDR notation this is designated by a /24 following the IP address. So:
- IP address 192.168.1.168 subnet mask 255.255.255.0 is written as:  192.168.1.168/24 in CIDR notation.

Write  the IP address 222.1.1.20 mask 255.255.255.192 in CIDR notation
Decimal 192 =11000000 binary which means that 2 bits of this octet are used for the subnet. Now add the 24 bits 255.255.255 and we have 26 bits. So we write:
222.1.1.20/26
