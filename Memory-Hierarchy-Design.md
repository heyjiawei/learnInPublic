Memory Hierarchy Design

The Memory Hierarchy Design levels:
(Highest level. Closest to program. Highest cost per bit. Lowest capacity and least access Time)

Level 0 - CPU Registers
level 1 - Cache Memory (SRAMs)
level 2 - Main Memory (DRAMs)
level 3 - Magnetic Disk (Disk Storage)
level 4 - Optical Disk and Magnetic Tape

(Lowest level. Furtherest from program. Lowest cost per bit. Highest capacity and longest access Time)

THe Memory Hierarchy Design is divided into 2 main types:
1. External memory or Secondary Memory
Comprising of Magnetic Disk, Optical Disk, Magnetic Tape i.e. peripheral storage devices which are accessible by the processor via I/O Module.
2. Internal memory or Primary Memory
Comprising of Main Memory, Cache Memory & CPU registers. This is directly accessible by the processor.
