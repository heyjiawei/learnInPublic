Signed and Unsigned

The "signed" indicator means that the item can hold positive or negative values. "Unsigned" doesn't distinguish between positive and negative values. A signed/unsigned variable can refer to any numerical data type (such as binary, integer, float, etc). Each data type might be further defined as signed or unsigned.

For example, an 8-bit signed binary could hold values from 0-127, both positive and negative (1 bit is used for the sign and 7 bits for the value), while an 8-bit unsigned binary could hold values from 0-255 (nothing distinguishes whether or not the value should be considered positive or negative, though it is commonly assumed to be positive).
