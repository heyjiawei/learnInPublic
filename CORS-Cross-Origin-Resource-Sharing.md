CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)

Same Origin Policy is a web security model. 
- web pages only allow scripts of the same origin (same protocol, hostname (exact match required) and port number) to access data in a second web page.
- This prevents a malicious script from one page from obtaining sensitive data on another page through the page's DOM
- This is to ensure there is a strict separation between content provided by unrelated sites are maintained, so as to prevent loss of data confidentiality or integrity
- applies to data access from scripts, embedded resources across origins (such as img, CSS)
