4 Key Characteristics of an ideal REIT
REITs investors face the same risks as any other stock investor. Hence, there is a need to do your due diligence and study the REIT that you are interested in.
1. Ideal REITs should not be overvalued
2. Ideal REITs need good outlook
3. Ideal REITs need to have a growth element
4. Ideal REITs need a good cap rate, not just good dividend yield

1. Ideal REITs should not be overvalued
REITs are an investment which rely on the underlying real estate’s ability to generate income. As with all real estate investments, valuation of the REIT is important.
You wouldn’t want to overpay when you buy your new home either. So why would you want to overpay for REITs?

2. Ideal REITs need good outlook
This outlook can refer to any macro trend from interest rate and regulatory trends to industry and economic trends.
REITs that are worth investing in should be in sub-sectors that have a good investment outlook. 
For example, we know that the global economy has been slowing down in the past few years. Because of this slowdown, it has indirectly impacted the rental market in the office REIT industry, leading to negative rental reversion. Therefore, it is unlikely for the rental market to have good outlook
Another example of macro trend is the rising importance of data centres as corporations begin to harvest data to implement data analytics. This directly increases the demand for data centres. Hence, REITs that offer such data storage services become a more desirable investment compared to office REITs in terms of investment outlook.

3. Ideal REITs need to have a growth element
The nature of REITs lies between the behaviour of a stock and a bond.

REITs own a portfolio of properties and receives rental income from the properties’ tenants. These rental incomes are then distributed to the shareholders after accounting for expenses. This gives REITs a bond-like feature of quarterly dividend payments to shareholders, just like the quarterly coupon payments that bondholders receive.

On the other hand, REITs also behave like a stock where speculation, better valuation and forward outlook can push its share price higher to give shareholders capital gains. These capital gains can be driven by any catalyst.

Thus, one important characteristic that good REIT investments need to possess is the growth element. Stock investors should be quite familiar with the idea of growth stocks.

Good REIT investments should continue to be growing its net income on a year-on-year basis.

Growth can come in two forms:

Organic growth through Asset Enhancement Initiatives (AEIs), positive rental reversion and increasing occupancy or capital recycling.
Inorganic growth through acquisition of new properties or invest in undeveloped properties.

4. Ideal REITs need a good cap rate, not just good dividend yield
Cap rate = capitalization rate = the rate of return on a property based on the income the property is expected to generate
cap rate measures a REIT’s income yielding ability against its underlying asset value 
distribution yield measures a REIT’s income against its market capitalization
Instead of just using distribution yield as your basis for comparison, use cap rate as an indicator of the REIT’s rental generating ability
A high cap rate can signal the management or property’s ability to command higher rental income. This can give you a better indication of whether the REIT in focus is actually generating good rental income or just using accounting shenanigans to make you think that it is a good investment.

Things to avoid when investing in REITs
1. Investing in REITs shouldn’t be just focusing on the potential dividend yield of the REIT.
2. Avoid REITs with poor macro outlook
3. Avoid REITs with high gearing (high debt)

1. Investing in REITs shouldn’t be just focusing on the potential dividend yield of the REIT.
As investors, we tend to have selection bias in focusing on REITs that have higher dividend yields and avoid those that have lower yields. This selection bias stems from our thinking that the return we get is purely from dividends, which isn’t true!
Apart from dividends, we would expect to make capital gains as well. So rather than looking at dividend alone, we should instead be looking at the total return that we can generate from the REIT.

2. Avoid REITs with poor macro outlook
As for any real estate investment, the macro outlook of the economy influences the returns of the investment. 
For REITs, there are five sub-sectors: Office, Retail, Industrial, Hospitality and Healthcare. Each sub-sector has a different outlook considering the economics factors affecting them.
There are still outstanding REITs within each sub-sector. 
**However, the opportunity cost of investing in outstanding REITs of sub-sectors with poor macro outlook is still high. The capital could be put into better use in sub-sectors that have good growth potential.

3. Avoid REITs with high gearing (high debt)
Most REITs typically use debt to finance the acquisition of new properties into their portfolio. This means they borrow from banks to finance their acquisitions
Thus, investments in REITs will expose investors to interest rate risk. This means that as interest rate increases, it will negatively impact the earnings of REITs and thus, affect the distribution for REITs.
To determine the relative amount of debt a REIT has, we use gearing ratio as a gauge. Gearing ratio represents a REIT’s amount of debt over its total assets. As the ratio increases, it signifies the more debt the REIT has over each unit of asset. Investors are exposed to higher interest rate risk when REITs are over-leveraged (high gearing level).

While we are not saying that all REITs with high gearing ratio shouldn’t be considered, we need to keep in mind that higher gearing ratio exposes our portfolio to higher interest rate risk.

(Note that there are also some REITs that raise finance through equity via rights issue like Sabana REIT, Ascott Residence Trust and Keppel REIT).

6 Sectors of REITs In Singapore
1. Retail REITs
2. Residential REITs
3. Office REITs
4. Industrail REITs
5. Hospitality REITs
6. Healthcare REITs

1. Retail REITs
Shopping malls you visit are most probably owned by a retail REIT.
Assess the health of the retail industry itself, as it is one of the major influence factors of your future profits
Retail REITs generate profits by renting space to its tenants. If their tenants have cash flow issues, they may not be able to pay their rent on time. 
If you intend to invest in retail REITs, look out for those with very strong anchor tenants. 
Once you’ve finished with your analysis, you have to analyze the REIT itself. Look for signs of strong balance sheets, sustainable profits and little debt.
In a troubled economy, retail REITs with cash on hand will be able to purchase good real estate at very discounted prices. Smart REIT managers are always going to take advantage of such situations.​

2. Residential REITs
Rising rents combined with low supply are ideal conditions for residential REITs.
When analysing such REITs, consider how affordable homes are in the target area, compared to the country average.
Wherever home affordability is low, the number of people who are forced to rent is higher, thus increasing the rental prices and REIT price.
As a consequence, most major residential REITs focus on big urban areas.
Investors also look at population and job growth. Cities with blossoming economy attract more people, therefore bringing a higher demand for rental homes.
As in any other industry, companies with the strongest balance sheets afford to make the best investments.

3. Office REITs
Their income comes from the rental of office space. The main advantage is that they usually deal with long term leases.
There are a few things to consider before investing in an office REIT:
- The state of the economy
- The unemployment rate and its trend
- The vacancy rates
- The economic well-being of the area in which the REITs makes its investments
- The capital available for acquisitions
Office REITs may also be seen as a subset of industrial REITs.

4. Industrial REITs
Industrial REITs manage and own industrial facilities, they rent these spaces to their tenants. These spaces include (but are not limited to) warehouses, distribution centers and specialised facilities.
It’s important to take a look at the spaces and facilities that these REITs own and understand the industry players whom are renting the spaces.
Note that due to the shear volume of space each facility holds, losing a tenant may be a huge blow for industrial REITs with little assets.

5. Hospitality REITs
These REITs hold properties in the hospitality sector such as hotels, budget accommodations, serviced apartments or short term lodging facilities.
When the economy is poor, the hospitality sector would be expected to face lower sales and occupancy rates, especially if the hotel is focused on tourism.
It is good to take a look at the properties owned by the hospitality REIT and understand its average occupancy rate. 
As these properties are sustained by short term stays and lease, their performance can be volatile and highly responsive to economic movements.

6. Healthcare REITs
Healthcare REITS focus their investments in various medical facilities such as hospitals, medical centers, nursing homes and retirement facilities. Their success is tightly connected to the evolution of the healthcare system.
When looking to invest in healthcare REITs, you should choose the ones that rely on a diversified group of clients with a wide range of property types.
Also check that the REITs of your choice have significant healthcare experience.
