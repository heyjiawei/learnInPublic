REITs terminology
Weighted Lease Average Expiry (WALE)
This is a metric used by investors to access the likelihood of REITs properties portfolio being vacant. Low occupancy would hurt REITs earnings and therefore, result in a distribution loss
There are 2 ways to measure WALE 
1. Using Rentable area
2. Using retal income measured across all tenants remaining lease in years

Property #1: 15% of gross rental income with 5 years of remaining lease term
Property #2: 70% of gross rental income with 2 years of remaining lease term
Property #3: 15% of gross rental income with 10 years of remaining lease term
Therefore, the WALE is:
(0.15 * 5) + (0.7 * 2) + (0.15 * 10) = 3.65 years

What it tells us is that the average lease expiry of the properties portfolio is 3.65 years.

As with all metrics, the figure has to be measured across similar sectors to conclude whether it is over or below the industry average.

High WALE implies greater income protection due to later lease expiry term. However, the main downside is that the REIT is not able to capitalize higher rental during market boom as its average lease expiry is longer.

Low WALE, on the other hand, has higher susceptibility towards rental market movement as shorter expiry term means frequent rental renewal. This allows the REIT to capitalize higher rental but at the same time means that it is susceptible to lower rental yield during bad time.

Accretive Acquisition
Accretive = growth or increase by gradual addition, in finance and general nomenclature. An acquisition is considered accretive if it adds to the item's value or corporation's earnings per share.
When an acquisition is accretive, the company would expect to produce higher EPS when it acquires properties. Therefore it is able to give a higher distribution to investors.
Acquisition that is not yield accretive would be seen as destroying investor value.

Rights Issue
A rights issue is a right to buy additional shares / units in a REIT. 
For example, rights issue of 1:4 means for every four shares you own, you have the option to purchase 1 share at a discounted price as stated in the rights issue.
It is issued to the REIT’s existing unit holders, usually at a discounted market price in proportion to their holdings.
REITs often use rights issue to raise capital for potential acquisition that are deems to be yield accretive. 
Unlike raising through debt, rights issue does not increase the financial gearing of the REITs.

Benefit
Existing unit holders are given the opportunity to purchase more of their holdings at a cheaper price than what they get from the stock market

Disadvantage
As rights issue require REITs to create more units, investors who do not participate in the offering would often find their proportion of unit holdings diluted

DPU (Distrubution per unit)
DPU = distribution per unit. It tells investors how much dividend they would get for every share they own

NAV (Net Asset Value)
It gives us an indicative value of what investors would get if the Company liquidates all of its assets and pays off its liability.

**NAV Per Share = (Assets Market Value – Liabilities Value) ÷ Number of Shares.

NAV is normally used to compare against market prices to determine above or under valuation of the assets.

RNAV (Revalued Net Asset Value)
This is similar to NAV with the exception that the assets and liabilities are adjusted to market value. 
RNAV is mostly used on property stocks with land that are valued at old prices
**RNAV Per Share = (Revised Assets Market Value – Revised Liabilities Value) ÷ Number of Shares.

Gearing (aka debt ratio)
**Gearing (Debt-to-Equity Ratio) = Total Debt ÷ Total Equity
**Gearing (Debt Ratio) = Total Debt ÷ Total Assets

A company with high gearing is said to be more vulnerable during recession as it has to continue to pay interest no matter how bad the earnings are.
Should the REIT be unable to pay its interest or principal on time, the REIT may fold up. 
Since July 2015, MAS has imposed a gearing limit of 45% for all REITs.

Capitalization Rate (aka Property Yield)
It is a measure of the property income yielding capability. Most REITs have their individual property Cap. Rate stated in their annual report.
**Cap rate = Net Operating Income / Property Value

A high Cap. Rate suggests either the REIT managers’ abilities to negotiate for higher income or could also mean the property value has depressed.

AEI (Asset Enhancement Initiative)
Refurbishment, revamp and upgrades of existing property assets are examples of Asset Enhancement Initiatives.
The goal is to optimise the value of a REIT’s existing asset properties value with the aim of increasing rental income. This is very common in Singapore especially in shopping malls.
