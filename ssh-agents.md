SSH agents
- If your private key is encrypted with a passphrase, this passphrase must be entered every time you attempt to connect to an SSH server using public-key authentication

The SSH agent is a program which caches your decrypted keys and provides them to SSH client programs on your behalf. 

- An SSH agent is typically configured to run automatically upon login and persist for the duration of your login session.
