AMP (Accelerated Mobile Page)
Very fast webpage - a HTML page designed to be super lightweight.
Designed for pure readability, pure speed
Images don't load until they are scrolled into view
Designed to be really heavily cached so Google can host these pages without fetching

How is it made so fast?
- Certain tags of HTML cannot be used (AMP HTML)
- need to use a streamlined version of CSS
- Javascript is not allowed at all. You have to use an off-the-shelf Javascript library that they provide you with, and that provides things like lazy loading (AMP JS)
- Google caches it (AMP Cache)

Impact on Search Results
- It is mobile only
