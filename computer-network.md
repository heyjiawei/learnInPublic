DNS Server:
DNS stands for Domain Name system.
DNS is basically a server which translate web addresses or URL (ex: www.google.com) into their corresponding IP addresses. We don’t have to remember all the IP addresses of each and every website.
The command ‘nslookup’ gives you the IP address of the domain you are looking for. This also provides the information of our DNS Server.

ARP:
ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol.
It is used to convert the IP address to its corresponding Physical Address(i.e.MAC Address).
ARP is used by the Data Link Layer to identify the MAC address of the Receiver’s machine.

Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the address of the resource.
The URL consists mainly of two parts:
The protocol used in transfer, e.g., HTTP.
The domain name.

URI stands for ‘Uniform Resource Identifier’
it’s like an address providing a unique global identifier to a resource on the Web. Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the most commonly used form of a URI.

The internet vs the web
Internet is the library and web a collection of books. The internet also consists of databases, email, forums, etc.
Web is a subset of the internet. The web is a large portion of the internet but it isn’t all of it.

The internet is a network, a way of transporting content and web lets us use that content.
The Web is ideally a way of accessing information over the medium of the Internet. Web is a collection of internet servers that can host HTML formatted documents. A collection of pages, of information connected to each other around the globe. Each page can be a combination of text and multimedia.
