Hosting a website:
Options:
Local Hosting - hosting in your own machine at home.
- fine for single user
- not always on, hence not always accessible
- IP may change (generally service providers may charge you more for a static IP) You want to ensure your IP address - the location of your machine on the internet - doesn't change.
	- If you have a domain name, that domain name will be mapped to an IP address

Co-locate:
buying space in a rack in a datacenter
(you still buy your own machines, and you install them in this data center)
- you have control over the machines (you can build the machines/ configure them however you want)
- generally pay for rent, power, bandwidth

Managed hosting:
a third party manages your server hardware, you rent machines (perhaps by the hour/ day/ month)
You get to configure the OS on your machine. If the server goes down, the third party will bring it up for you
- you get the benefits of co-locating without needing to do any physical work

Google App Engine/ Heroku
- no 'machines' so as to speak. Zero sys-administration
- difficult to customize
