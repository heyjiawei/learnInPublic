Generating an SSH key pair
- An SSH key pair can be generated by running the ssh-keygen command
- Defaults to RSA hash (3072-bit RSA (and SHA256) ). It should be sufficient for most cases and compatible with virtually all clients and servers
- The key's randomart image was created as a means of easier identification of the key's fingerprint.
```
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|   ooo.          |
|   oo+.          |
|  + +.+          |
| o +   +     E . |
|  .   . S . . =.o|
|     . + . . B+@o|
|      + .   oo*=O|
|       .   ..+=o+|
|           o=ooo+|
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Choosing the key location and passphrase:
- By default, keys are stored in the ~/.ssh/ directory and named according to the type of encryption used.
- It is possible to create your private key without a passphrase. This can be convinent but dangerous.
	- Without a passphrase, your private key will be stored on disk in an unencrypted form.
	-  Anyone who gains access to your private key will be able to assume your identity on any SSH server you connect with this private key

Changing the private key's passphrase without changing the key
```
$ ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -p
```

Manging multiple keys
- it is possible to use the same SSH key pair for multiple hosts.
- It is also easy to maintain distinct keys for multiple hosts by using the IdentityFile directive in openSSH config file

Copying the public key to the remote server
- after generating a key pair, you need to copy the public key to the remote server so it will use SSH key authentication.
- The public key shares the same name as the private key except it is appended with .pub extension
